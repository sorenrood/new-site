I am currently building something new at <a href="https://shv.com" target="_blank">Sutter Hill Ventures</a>.

Previously, I was a product manager at <a href="https://www.Replit.com" target="_blank">Replit</a> where I built tools for software creators. Some of my work there includes <a href="https://blog.replit.com/deployments-launch" target="_blank">Deployments</a>, <a href="https://blog.replit.com/ghostwriter" target="_blank">Replit AI</a>, and <a href="https://blog.replit.com/bounties" target="_blank">Bounties</a>.

Before Replit, I was a software engineer where I built liquidity systems (market makers) for various brokerages.
